#### ROS2 Environment Setup
To automatically setup the ROS2 environment on your cobot:
1. Open `.bashrc` for editing:
```
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```
2. Add the following to the end of `.bashrc`:
```
# Source ROS Jazzy setup with error checking
if source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash; then
 echo "Sourced /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash successfully"
else
 echo "Failed to source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash"
fi

# Explicit setting of DDS
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp
echo "DDS set to $RMW_IMPLEMENTATION"

# Source your workspace setup with error checking
if source ~/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash; then
 echo "Sourced ~/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash successfully"
else
 echo "Failed to source ~/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash"
fi

# Export and print ROS_DOMAIN_ID
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=4
echo "ROS_DOMAIN_ID is set to $ROS_DOMAIN_ID"

# ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY is being fazed out but is good for a quick set up
export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=0
echo "ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY is set to $ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY"

echo "To change this automation, use nano to edit ~/.bashrc and the source ~/.bashrc to apply."
```
2. Save and exit with`CTRL+X`. Source to apply the changes:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
